  <h1>A* Search with Multiple Targets and Sources</h1>

  <p>A couple months ago, I decided to expand my knowledge of artificial intelligence by participating in the <a href="http://aichallenge.org">2011 AI Challenge</a>. It was an incredibly interesting and educational experience. Sadly, I was forced to divert my attention away from the AI Challenge to focus on more important things.</p>
<p>One of the more interesting things I learned from the AI Challenge was an A* algorithm which supports searching from multiple sources to multiple targets, simultaneously. I used this algorithm to efficiently gather food: one pass of this algorithm calculated paths to each food tile.</p>
<p>The algorithm is similar to the basic A*, except for a few key differences. First of all, the frontier is prepopulated with all of the sources. Secondly, the goal test function checks to see if the current position corresponds to <em>any</em> of the targets, not just a single target. Finally, the heuristic is the Manhattan distance to the <em>nearest</em> target.</p>
<p>This is the algorithm in pseudocode:</p>
<pre><code>frontier = {sources}
explored = {}
loop:
    if frontier is empty: return
    path = remove_choice(frontier) # minimize f + h where h = distance to nearest target
    s = path.end
    add s to explored
    if s in targets: command source to follow path
    for a in actions:
        add [path + a -&gt; Result(s, a)] to frontier
            unless Result(s, a) in frontier + explored</code></pre>
<p>Iâ€™ve <a href="https://github.com/zacharydenton/aichallenge-ants">uploaded my bot to GitHub</a>, so you can actually <a href="https://github.com/zacharydenton/aichallenge-ants/blob/master/MyBot.java#L237">see this algorithm in practice</a> if you want.</p>

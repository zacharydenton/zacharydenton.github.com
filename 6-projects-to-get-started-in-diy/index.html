  <h1>6 Projects to Get Started in DIY</h1>

  <p>One of my favorite past-times is building things using instructions found on sites like <a href="http://www.instructables.com/" title="Instructables">Instructables</a>. Here are some of my favorite projects to get you started in the exciting world of DIY. The great thing about these designs is that each one is only a starting point in its respective field – once built, each one has enormous potential for upgrading and customization.</p>
<h2 id="cmoy-headphone-amplifier"><a href="http://tangentsoft.net/audio/cmoy-tutorial/" title="CMoy Headphone Amplifier">CMoy Headphone Amplifier</a></h2>

</div>
<p>If you’re into music, you should consider building a CMoy amp. It’s a fantastic way to improve your electronics skills and your sound quality at the same time. I started an electronics club at my school so I could develop the skills necessary to build this thing – it’s that good of a project.</p>
<h2 id="penny-stove"><a href="http://www.jureystudio.com/pennystove/" title="Penny Ultralight Backpacking Stove">Penny Stove</a></h2>
<p>A surprisingly powerful (and light) backpacking stove can be made with little more than a few beer cans. I have used these stoves in the field with great success. Fuel can be purchased at any hardware store – it’s just denatured alcohol. The cool thing about this stove is that it is not only much cheaper than its commercial competition, but it is also much lighter and equally powerful. An exception to Keith Bontrager’s aphorism, “Strong. Light. Cheap. Pick Two.”</p>
<h2 id="potato-cannon"><a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/The-Original-Potato-Cannon/" title="The Original Potato Cannon">Potato Cannon</a></h2>
<p>The potato cannon is a classic summer project. There’s nothing quite so invigorating as transforming a mundane object like a potato into a high-powered projectile capable of flying hundreds of feet. The basic concept behind the potato cannon: plug the barrel with a potato, fill the chamber with flammable aerosol, and trigger an explosion in the chamber – forcing the potato out at high speed.</p>
<h2 id="water-rocket"><a href="http://exploration.grc.nasa.gov/education/rocket/BottleRocket/about.htm" title="NASA Water Rocketry">Water Rocket</a></h2>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>The water rocket is another fun summer project. It is possible to send ordinary 2 liter soda bottles into the sky with a highly-pressurized mixture of air and water. Once you get started building water rockets, you will find that people have developed some incredible designs – two stage rockets, rockets made from fluorescent light tubing, <a href="http://www.uswaterrockets.com/world/world_story_11.htm" title="X-2 Water Rocket">a rocket that flew over 2000 feet</a> – there is a lot of potential for improving your rocket.</p>
<h2 id="blowgun"><a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Professional-Blowgun-and-Dart---Pierce-12-Plywoo/" title="How to Make a Blowgun">Blowgun</a></h2>
<p>This silent-but-deadly weapon is easily made using parts from your local hardware store. I use electrical conduit for the blowgun itself and metal coat hangers as the darts. Once built, it is an excellent weapon for hunting small game such as rabbits or frogs. I’ve developed a nice upgrade for my own blowgun: I attached an old fishing reel to the front of the blowgun. I then attach the fishing line to the dart which gives me the ability to reel in my catch! This is great for hunting frogs, as they tend to jump away unless you can pin them to the ground.</p>
<h2 id="paracord-sling"><a href="http://slinging.org/index.php?page=5-strand-woven-paracord-sling-tutorial---jeffrey" title="Paracord Sling Tutorial">Paracord Sling</a></h2>
<p>Paracord is an extremely versatile material – you can use it to make a fishing net, weave a belt, make an excellent handle for your knife, and of course to tie things together. In this case, one can weave it into a sling capable of hurling fist-sized rocks hundreds of feet. The sling is a weapon that requires an immense amount of training to develop proficiency. I can certainly imagine hundreds of slingers lobbing rocks at an oncoming army, though.</p>

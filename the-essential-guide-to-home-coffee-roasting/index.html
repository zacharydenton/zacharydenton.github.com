  <h1>The Essential Guide to Home Coffee Roasting</h1>

  <p>Every once in a while I come across a DIY project that is both cheaper and better than its commercial counterpart. I’m talking about things like the <a href="http://www.jureystudio.com/pennystove/" title="Penny Stove">alcohol stove</a>, <a href="http://lifehacker.com/#!178132/hack-attack-turn-your-60-router-into-a-600-router" title="Turn Your $60 Router Into a $600 Router">DD-WRT</a>, and the <a href="http://tangentsoft.net/audio/cmoy-tutorial/" title="How to Build the CMoy Headphone Amplifier">CMoy amp</a>. Recently I have added a new item to this list: home coffee roasting.</p>
<h2 id="why-you-should-roast-at-home">Why you should roast at home</h2>
<p>You may ask why someone would want to roast coffee at home, instead of just buying a pound or two from the store.</p>
<h3 id="its-cheaper-than-store-bought-coffee">It’s cheaper than store-bought coffee</h3>
<p>As I alluded to above, it’s cheaper to roast your own coffee than to buy it from the store. You can purchase 4 pounds of organic raw coffee for 20 bucks. Plus you save a trip to the store!</p>

<h3>
It tastes better than store-bought coffee
</h3>
Furthermore, it tastes better than commercial coffee. No doubt the fact that you have made it yourself has something to do with this, but after trying it I’m sure you will agree.
<h3>
Complete control
</h3>
<p>The third major advantage is control. Do you prefer lightly roasted wet-processed organic coffee from Ethiopia? No problem. The variety of raw coffee beans for sale is astonishing, and once you have the beans you can roast them however you like. You can even experiment with blends of different growing regions and roast profiles.</p>
<h2>
Why you shouldn’t roast at home
</h2>
<p>The downside of roasting coffee at home is that it requires more effort than purchasing coffee yourself. You will probably have to roast coffee at least once a week. There’s more to roasting coffee than just picking a bag from the shelf and pouring it into your coffee maker. If you consider that to be a drawback, coffee roasting may not be for you.</p>
On the other hand, if you think that getting some of the best coffee in the world at the cost of a little extra effort sounds like an excellent idea, read on.
<h2>
Selecting the beans
</h2>
<p>First and foremost, you will need something to roast. I recommend purchasing from <a title="Sweet Maria's" href="http://www.sweetmarias.com/">Sweet Maria’s</a>, a site which specializes in home coffee roasting. They have an incredible selection of raw beans for sale. They also have some samplers, which I highly recommend if you are just getting started with coffee roasting. If you opt to purchase a sampler, you will receive several bags of coffee selected to give you an overview of the different tastes associated with different growing regions.</p>

</div>
After you finish off the sampler, you will have an idea of which regions and roasting styles you prefer. Once you know what you like, you can make more specific purchases.
<h2>
Equipment
</h2>
<p>As with most DIY projects, you’ll need some equipment to get started.</p>
<h3>
Roasier
</h3>
<p>The roaster is the most important piece of equipment needed for coffee roasting. There are a lot of choices here. For example, there are ways to roast coffee on your stovetop and there are also a variety of commercial offerings. However, the roaster that I recommend is actually a popcorn popper. That’s right, you can repurpose an old popcorn popper for coffee roasting. The specific model I use is the West Bend Poppery II. You can find these for sale on eBay or at your local thrift store.</p>
Here’s a list of popcorn poppers known to work for roasting coffee:
<ul>

West Bend Poppery II (1200 watt model) - the one I use
</li>

<h3>
Container
</h3>
You can use any glass jar or container . Just make sure that it has a lid which can be sealed.
<h3>
Cooling method
</h3>
You can either use a metal colander or a metal cookie sheet. The important thing is that it will absorb heat from the hot freshly roasted beans.
<h3>
Measuring cup
</h3>
Any 1/2 cup measuring cup will suffice.
<h2>
Method
</h2>
<p>Roasting coffee is both an art and a science. You may not end up with exactly what you were hoping for the first time around, but with practice you will achieve consistent results.</p>
While there are those who have installed thermometers and computers into their roasters to ensure that the coffee meets their exact specifications, this guide will take a more artistic approach.
<h3>
Select the coffee you will be using
</h3>
<p>The first thing to do is to select the coffee you will be roasting and how you intend to roast it. If you purchased the coffee from Sweet Maria’s, the bag will have some roasting recommendations printed on it, such as “City–Full City+”. I typically follow these recommendations, since the Sweet Maria’s people are more knowledgeable than I am about which coffees are best roasted lightly and which are not.</p>

</div>
<h3>
Gather materials and set up roaster
</h3>
<p>Gather the rest of your materials and set up your roaster somewhere indoors. If you try to roast outside, your roaster will probably struggle to achieve the required temperature and thus produce an inferior result.</p>
The roasting process produces a large amount of a flaky substance called “chaff”. It’s best if you situate your roaster such that the chaff will fall into your sink, so that you can just flush it away when finished.
<h3>
Pour a half-cup of the coffee into the roaster
</h3>
Once you’ve finished setting up, you will need to measure about a half-cup of the green coffee and pour it into the roaster. It’s important not to overfill the roaster, as this will result in an uneven roast.
<h3>
Roast until you achieve the desired roast level
</h3>
<p>This is the part that gets a bit more interesting. In coffee roasting, you will hear people refer to the “first crack” and “second crack”. These are terms which describe phases of the roasting process.</p>
<p>The first crack starts about two minutes into the roasting process. You will know when it starts because it produces popping sounds like popcorn in the microwave. It lasts for one to two minutes. The pops will slow down until eventually all of the beans have “cracked”. At this point, you have achieved a “City” roast. This is the lightest roast that I recommend.</p>
<p>After a minute of silence, the popping will return with renewed vigor. This is the start of the “second crack”. If you stop the roast now, you will have a “Full City” roast.</p>
If you keep the roast going for a minute or so, you will have a “French” roast. Beyond this point, you get something called charcoal.
<h3>
Pour the coffee into your cooling device
</h3>

</div>
<p>Once you have achieved the desired roast, you need to turn off the roaster and pour the coffee beans into your cooling device. The goal is to cool the beans as quickly as possible so that they don’t continue to roast. Just shake the beans around for a bit until they’ve cooled down enough that you can touch them.</p>
<h3>
Once cooled, store the coffee for 6-12 hours
</h3>
Pour the cooled coffee beans into your storage jar. You want to leave the lid slightly ajar so that the coffee is able to vent gases. The degassing period takes around 6-12 hours and it is inadvisable to drink the coffee during this time. I usually leave the coffee overnight so that it’s ready in the morning.
<h3>
Enjoy
</h3>
<p>If you’ve gotten to this point, congratulations are in order: you are now a home coffee roaster. Time to enjoy some delicious home roasted coffee!</p>
Grind up the coffee, and brew it with a french press (or alternative roasting method of choice). Fill up a mug, and if all went well, you are now a privileged drinker of some of the best coffee in the world. Once you’ve tried home roasted coffee you won’t settle for anything less!

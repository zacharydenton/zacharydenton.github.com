<p>I arrived at Keflavik airport at about 2 AM. I was planning on spending the night at the airport, but unfortunately the airport is very small outside of the main terminal. I ended up taking the airport shuttle in to Reykjavik and arrived in the city center at around 3 AM. I went to 4 different hostels before finding a place with any vacancy. The place I ended up at, Reykjavik City Hostel, is about a 30 minute walk outside of Reykjavik. It was interesting because the average age of the people staying there was about 30. Iceland is an expensive place; apparently even people in their 30s can’t afford hotels there!</p>

<p>The following day I explored Reykjavik. I started off the day by going to a coffee shop. The great thing about Iceland is that the coffee shops have free refills. This was a welcome relief from the Icelandic prices. I walked around Reykjavik for a bit, and ate salmon kebab and lobster soup at <a href="http://travel.nytimes.com/2006/11/12/travel/12bite.html">Sægreifinn</a>.</p>

<p>After that, I walked up to Hallgrímskirkja.</p>

<p>On the way back down the hill, I stopped inside Mokka Kaffi and had a waffle and a cappuccino.</p>

</div>
<p>I walked around Reykjavik a bit more, bought some groceries, and made the long walk back to the hostel.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p>The next day was similar to the first. For breakfast, I enjoyed “The Truck” (pancakes, bacon, scrambled eggs, and coffee) at Grái Kötturinn. For dinner, I had the best hot dogs in the world at Bæjarins Bestu.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>These hot dogs were probably the best food I purchased on the entire trip. In Iceland, you’re supposed to order a hot dog with everything (<em>ein með öllu</em>).</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>When Bill Clinton came to this hot dog stand, he ordered one with only mustard. Today, they serve the “Clinton”, which is a hot dog with only mustard. No one ever orders that, though.</p>
<p>When young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more I took the bus to go hiking at Esjan, a popular day hiking spot outside of Reykjavik. I missed one of the buses, so I ended up spending a couple hours at a bakery about 10 miles away from Esjan. I had a nice cinnamon pastry and a cappuccino (and internet), so it wasn’t a problem. When I got to Esjan, it was about 4 PM.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>The guidebook said that the Esjan hike takes about 3 hours to complete, so I was worried I might not make it back in time to catch the last bus of the day. I proceeded swiftly up the mountain, passing several people along the way.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p>A couple of locals passed me, but they were jogging up and down the mountain.</p>

</div>
<p>It was extremely damp at the top of the mountain, probably because the top of the mountain was inside a cloud.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>I was hiking with my brown loafers so I decided not to climb the last 50 meters to the top. Still worried that I might not catch the evening bus back to Reykjavik, I ran all the way down the mountain. I almost caught up with the locals who passed me earlier. The hike ended up lasting a little over an hour.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p>There was a restaurant at the bottom of the mountain called Esjustofa, where I had a coffee and some carrot cake.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p>I caught the final bus of the day without any problems.</p>

<p>The next day, I took a bus along the spectacular Ring Road to a place east of Reykjavik, called Vik.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p>Vik is a small village by the coast.</p>

</div>
<p>I was extremely lucky to get the last bed at the tiny hostel in Vik. I’m honestly not sure what I would have done had I not gotten that bed, because it was pouring rain outside and there didn’t seem to be any other options within my budget for miles.</p>
<p>I got up the next morning and went for a walk along the seaside cliffs.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>I passed by a rock formation that looks kind of like a submerged stegosaurus. This was a really nice hike.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p>Several sheep grazed alongside me.</p>

</div>
<p>On the way back, the rain and fog returned with a vengeance. It was literally raining sideways. When I made it back to the hostel, I was completely drenched. I took advantage of the free food shelf at the hostel, making an interesting combination of cous cous, salami, and alphabet soup. I made a trek through the rain to the gas station, where a westbound bus was departing. I took the bus to a port where I took a ferry to the Westman Islands, a group of volcanic islands south of Iceland.</p>
<p>When I arrived in Heimaey (the main Westman Island), I had to find a place to stay. The guidebook didn’t have too much to say about Heimaey, as it is a bit off the beaten path. It did mention that Heimaey is Iceland’s most important fishing town.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>I went to the main hotel on the island, but it was way out my price range. They didn’t have any space in their hostel either. Fortunately for me they called a friend of theirs who ran a gistihús (guesthouse) on the outskirts of town.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>The guesthouse price was decent, about twice as much as the Reykjavik hostel. Inside the guesthouse, I met a German family drinking vodka and eating fermented shark (Iceland’s equivalent of surströmming). The fermented shark was actually not too bad. I walked into town to grab some dinner, and ended up with an overpriced pizza.</p>
<p>The next day, I set out to explore the island.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>The first thing I did was hike up one of the volcanic hills that surround the island.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>It was pretty steep; you had to use ropes to climb up.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>There was a nice view at the top.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>Also, this wasn’t climbing on solid ground. This was climbing on volcanic sand, so it was like climbing on a diagonal beach. The great thing about this was that you could “surf” the whole way down. Very exciting. From there, I walked into town in search of some lunch. I went to the grocery store and purchased a roasted chicken and two liters of Coke. I found a picnic table in town and devoured the chicken. I ate the chicken with such savage haste that an Asian couple actually came up to me and asked if they could take a photograph. Who knows what strange corner of the internet that photo ended up at. After that, I walked over to the lava fields on the other side of town.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>The lava was already solidified, of course. For some reason I was expecting to see some flowing red lava, though. Maybe in Hawaii.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>I also hiked up a volcano.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-9lEII7rg8j4/TkXMJ6dWtdI/AAAAAAAAb3E/ap8_AH7qxMw/s1000/IMG_20110806_143331.jpg" alt="On top of a volcano" /><p class="caption">On top of a volcano</p>
</div>
<p>It was interesting because the volcano was still warm. If you dug down a bit I’m sure you would burn your hand. It was cool to see clouds forming as wind blew over the top of the volcano.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>I took the ferry back to the mainland and took the bus back to Reykjavik.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>It was quite late when I got back, so I wasn’t sure whether or not to book a hostel for the night. The bus company sold the tickets at half price if you took the bus at 4:30 AM, which was reason enough for me to just spend the night at the bus station. I withdrew my handy silk travel sheet from my suitcase and slept for a few hours until it was time to leave. Most of the people on the bus had been partying all night. I wish I had thought of that idea, but maybe next time. After a few flights and a car ride, I was back home in Maryland. It was without a doubt the best summer I’ve ever had.</p>

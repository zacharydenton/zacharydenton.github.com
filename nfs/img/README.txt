	This is a collection of skyboxes I created for my spacegame
	Project::OSiRiON. I've converted them to quake3 standards
	so they can used by quake3-derived engines.
	
	Originally, the skies were rendered at 2048x2048. Because
	neither Tremulous nor Unvanquished seemed to like this resolution
	I had to convert them to 1024x1024. The source XML files are included
	in this release: if required, you can always render them 
	to higher resolution images,
	
	All the skyboxes were created with Alex Peterson's Spacescape:

	A preliminary version of a guide I'm writing can be found here:

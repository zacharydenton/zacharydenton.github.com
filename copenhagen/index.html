  <h1>Copenhagen</h1>

  <p>My visit to Copenhagen was relatively uneventful. The main thing I did was go to the <a href="http://www.coffeecollective.dk/">Coffee Collective</a>, a coffee roastery run by a former World Barista Champion.</p>
<!-- more -->

<p>I’m not entirely sure what that means. At the Coffee Collective, I tried a coffee which was blended with bergamot, like Earl Grey tea. It wasn’t very good. When I got back to the US, I searched for different Aeropress brewing techniques and came across <a href="http://coffeecollective.blogspot.com/2010/01/updated-aeropress-brewing-method.html">the technique that Coffee Collective uses</a>. I’m not sure if it really improves the flavor but it is certainly more complicated.</p>
<p>I also lost my phone charger at the hostel I was staying at. This effectively doubled the cost of staying at the hostel. I don’t understand how the worst hostel on my trip could be in Copenhagen.</p>
<p>After the short stay in Copenhagen, I went to the airport and hopped on a plane headed for Iceland.</p>

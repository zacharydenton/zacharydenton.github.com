  <h1>Prague</h1>

<p>I spent a couple days in Prague. Here I found some of the most impressive Gothic architecture I’ve ever seen - it looked straight out of The Lord of the Rings.</p>
<p>Inspired by the Canadian I met in Budapest, I planned to stay at the cheapest hostel in Prague. It seemed like a pretty good place when I looked at their website in Vienna, although it’s situated well outside of the city center. As usual, I decided not to book in advance because it seemed unnecessary.</p>

<p>After arriving in Prague, I walked for a while and eventually reached the hostel. It was of course fully booked when I arrived. They told me about a place even farther away from the city center called “Vibe Hotel”. This was the only hostel/hotel on my trip that had a swimming pool. The people at this place were quite different from the usual hostel crowd of seasoned travelers. Mostly they were fresh college grads looking to party.</p>
<p>The next day I went for a great walk around the city.</p>

<p>First, I made the long trek from the hotel to the main square. The square was filled with people admiring the buildings and enjoying the weather.</p>

<p>After a brief lunch break, I walked across the bridge and up cobblestone streets to Prague Castle.</p>

<p>I explored the castle for a while, especially impressed by the cathedral.</p>

<p>I then crossed the river and walked alongside it until I completed the walking loop. I had some Chinese food for dinner and went to Berlin the next day.</p>

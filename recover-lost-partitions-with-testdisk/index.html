  <h1>Recover Lost Partitions with TestDisk</h1>

  <p>I was recently messing around with the <code>dd</code> program to write ISO images to USB drives, instead of wasting DVDs or CDs. The command to do this is as follows:</p>
<pre><code># dd if=archlinux-2010.05-netinstall-x86_64.iso of=/dev/sdX</code></pre>
<p>Where <code>sdX</code> is the device name of the disk you wish to write the image to.</p>
<p>This is alright if you only have two disks in your computer, where you would almost certainly want to write to <code>/dev/sdb</code>. However, if you have more than two disks, you need to be absolutely sure that you have selected the correct device — choose the wrong disk, and its data will be overwritten by that of the ISO image.</p>
<p>This is precisely what happened to me (twice, in fact!). I thought I was writing to my flash drive but it turned out that I was actually writing to my 1TB external backup drive. Luckily I had the presence of mind to kill the dd process after I realized that the activity light on the flash drive was not blinking, but the 80MB or so of data that was written was enough to destroy the <abbr title="Master Boot Record">MBR</abbr>. That’s a big problem because the MBR acts like a map telling the computer where data is located on the drive. Without that map, the drive is useless.</p>
<p>Thankfully, one Christophe Grenier has written a program called <a href="http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk">TestDisk</a> which scans the raw data of the hard drive and searches for lost partitions. I was able to recover the lost partitions on my drive using this fantastic tool.</p>
<p>It uses a few different methods to recover the lost partitions. First, it quickly scans through the entire hard drive, looking for lost partitions. Then, it gives you the option to perform a deeper search, which inspects the drive more carefully. Finally, it checks if there is a backup MBR on the device, and if so, uses it to replace the lost MBR.</p>
<p>This final option worked for me. Personally, I think this should be the first step performed, as it takes several hours to scan the entire drive twice whereas it presumably takes less than a second to inspect the backup MBR.</p>
<p>Check out this <a href="http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk_Step_By_Step">step-by-step guide</a> detailing its use.</p>
